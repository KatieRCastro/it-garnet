          <p>
            Take a canoe or kayak out on the water and experience the sheer
            beauty of the Buffalo River. As you navigate its crystal-clear

            allowing the gentle current to carry you downstream while you soak
            in the still atmosphere of this natural wonderland. Along the way, take 
            a swim in one of the inviting swimming holes scattered along the 
            riverbanks. So grab your paddle, pack a picnic, and embark on a 
            floating adventure that promises to leave you with memories to
            last a lifetime.
