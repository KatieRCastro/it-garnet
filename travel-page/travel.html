          The park encompasses over 95,000 acres that surround the free-flowing
          Buffalo, much of which is linked together by a growing network of
          trails to accommodate hiking and equestrian-based recreational
          activities. These trail systems also offer numerous side hikes to
          locations that showcase the natural and human history that have shaped
          the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only trails that allow dogs are the three Buffalo Point Campground
          trails (Forest Trail, Campground Trail, and Overlook Trail), the Tyler
          Bend Campground trails (Spring Hollow Trail, Buck Ridge Trail, and
          Rock Wall Trail), Mill Creek Trail, Villines Homestead Trail, and the
          Buffalo River Trail between Ponca and Steel Creek only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backcountry camping is allowed on the Buffalo River Trail and some of
          the park's other trails. Backcountry camping is not permitted on the
          Lost Valley Trail, Tyler Bend Campground Trails, Indian Rockhouse
          Trail, or Buffalo Point Campground Trails. Mobility devices are
          permitted in all areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget the sunscreen, bug spray, water, snacks, and sturdy
          footwear. We hope you have an enjoyable hike!

          <h3>What is a Zipline Canopy Tour?</h3>
          <p>
            Our canopy tour is a system of cables
            and platforms, wherein the participant “glides” or “zips” through
            the treetops while connected to the cable via a harness. A large
            wooden platform serves as a landing base in each tree that you “zip
            to.”

          <img src="assets/img/zipline2.webp" alt="Canoeing" />
          <h3>How Long Does It Take?</h3>
          <p>
            The tour takes approximately 2 hours to complete, give or take a few
            minutes. Precisely how long it lasts is determined by a variety of
            factors, including weather and the physical ability of each
            participant.

        <p>The tour is for guests ages 7+ and who weigh between 70 and 250 lbs. We zip rain or shine and during rainy day zips the weight limit may be reduced to 200 lbs.

          <h2>About the River</h2>
          <p>
            The Buffalo River was designated as America's first national river
            in 1972. It is managed by the National Park Service as the Buffalo
            National River. The river and its surrounding ecosystem support a
            diverse array of plant and animal life, including numerous species
            of fish, birds, and mammals. It is also home to a variety of unique
            geological features, such as caves and springs. Conservation efforts
            are ongoing to protect the ecological integrity of the Buffalo River
            and its surrounding watershed. The National Park Service, along with
            various conservation organizations and local stakeholders, work to
            preserve the river's natural resources and recreational
            opportunities for future generations. Overall, the Buffalo River
            holds significant cultural, recreational, and ecological importance,
            drawing visitors from across the country to experience its pristine
            beauty and outdoor activities.
