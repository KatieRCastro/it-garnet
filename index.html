    <h3>Park Site reflection and feedback</h3>
    <p>
      The park microsite is the second time I have been assigned to create a
      website on my own. This time around I was able to approach the assignment
      with more confidence in my knowledge.I felt more comfortable in branching
      out and exploring different designs. I think I did well when approaching
      the home page, I am really proud of the inclusion of the park video and
      the navigational bar. I think I could be better at exploring different
      layouts with different positioning techniques.The feedback I received
      helped me add more design features to tie the site together, before, my
      site pages were pretty simple, so I went in and added more color.I liked
      the minimalistic feel of the website but it definitely benefitted from the
      added color.I really enjoyed being able to pick from a wide variety of
      parks, It gave me creative freedom and made the process fun. After this
      project, I feel confident enough in my skills to create another website on
      my own.I understand that this field is forever changing , but I now feel
      confident in searching for what I need because I have a better
      understanding of the basics.

    <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement describes and emphasizes the importance of
      designing with a user first mentality.The article emphasizes the
      importance of establishing a solid foundation that performs well and is
      usable across all browsers.It is important to focus on the usability and
      experience rather than new interactivity and technology that does not
      perform well on older browsers.That being said, older browsers should
      always be considered when designing, excluding them is discriminatory.
