<p>Hiking in Arkansas Mount Magazine State Park offers some of the best hiking
in Arkansas along with a variety of Arkansas outdoor adventure activities.
Explore the Arkansas mountain biking trails, hang gliding locations and more!
Hikers can take a hike on the Signal Hill Trail, or the Greenfield, Benefield,
Mossback Ridge, or Will Apple's Road Trails and explore the many natural and
historical resources of the mountain as well as stunning views of Bear Hollow,
the Arkansas River Valley and Blue Mountain Lake. Hiking trails vary in length
from .5 to 2.8 miles. The total trails system in the park is 14.2 miles. In
addition, the park trails link to the USDA Forest Service's 9.7-mile Cove Lake
Trail and 34-mile Huckleberry Mountain Horse Trail that lead into the adjacent
Ozark National Forest. They can be enjoyed in as little as one hour, or for as
long as an overnight trip on our Arkansas backpacking trails, making it possible
to enjoy some of the best hiking in Arkansas for as long as you'd like. The
Huckleberry Mountain Horse Trail is the park's only multi-use trail and one of
the best places for horseback riding in Arkansas. Here ATVs, hikers, bikers, and
horse riders can follow the trail to the park boundary and continue into the
national forest for 34 miles of some of the best hiking in Arkansas and the most
scenic and rugged landscape in the state. Whether you're looking for strenuous,
multi-day hikes or great views of Blue Mountain Lake, hiking trail maps are

District office located at 3001 East Walnut Street in Paris.

<h3>Hiker Hints</h3> 
<p>STAY ON MARKED HIKING TRAILS IN ARKANSAS</p>
<p>Leaving established trails often creates new and confusing
trails. This can also destroy rare and delicate wildflowers, and cause
detrimental erosion. WATCH YOUR STEP Some Arkansas trails take you to the brink
of bluffs. To avoid accidents, be cautious of loose or wet rocks. Be aware of
rough terrain. Wear hiking boots, carry walking sticks, and drink plenty of
water. DO NO HARM Cutting switchbacks, picking flowers, throwing rocks, and
littering are a few ways people destroy the very environment they came to enjoy.
All plants and animals are protected within the park. AVOID UNWANTED ENCOUNTERS
Poison ivy is a common plant along many trails. Snakes will be seen from time to
time. To avoid encounters with either, remain on designated hiking trails in
Arkansas. BE AWARE OF BEARS Yes, there are black bears on Mount Magazine. They
usually avoid humans. However, bears are attracted to food. Do not feed bears
and never bring food into your tent. If you encounter a bear on a trail, slowly
back away and keep your distance.

nature-based tourism that provides responsible travel to natural areas while
conserving the environment. This federal and state partnership affords the
opportunity to cooperate jointly in the development of the mountain's
outstanding recreation potential. And it allows both agencies to cooperate in
the preservation, protection, and enhancement of the unique ecological resources
