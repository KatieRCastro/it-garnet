<h1>What To Know</h1>
<p>At the peak of the state park experience is Mount Magazine,
Arkansas’s highest point at 2,753 feet. People come for the sweeping views
alone, but there is much to see and do from this unique spot. Mount Magazine
State Park is a place of relaxation, exploration, nature study, and is within
the Ozark-St. Francis National Forests. It is a destination for outdoor sports
and extreme adventures with mountain biking, horseback riding, backpacking, and
ATV riding. Mount Magazine is the state park system’s most dramatic location for
technical rock climbing, and it’s one of only two parks to offer hang gliding
launch areas. Scenic overlooks, hiking trails, picnic area, pavilion, and
visitor center with gift shop add to the amenities. A wide variety of programs
led by park interpreters highlights the mountain’s natural diversity. 
</p>

<p>The Lodge
at Mount Magazine features 60 guest rooms, Skycrest Restaurant, a conference
center, business center, heated indoor swimming pool, fitness center, and game
room. From its setting on the mountain’s south bluff, the lodge offers
breathtaking views of the Petit Jean River Valley and Blue Mountain Lake in the
distance. Its beautiful setting and first-class facilities make the lodge a top
choice for romantic getaways, weddings, conferences, and corporate retreats. The
conference space can be divided into three meeting rooms or opened up for
banquet-style seating for up to 192 people. Skycrest Restaurant seats up to 125.
Thirteen cabins share the same view as the lodge. Choose from one-, two-, and
three-bedroom options with fully equipped kitchens, fireplaces, and covered
decks with outdoor hot tubs. There are also 18 campsites on the mountain (two
Class AAA and 16 Class AA with tent-only options).
